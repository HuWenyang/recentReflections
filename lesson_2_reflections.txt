What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to do it because a git repository will have a .git directory that tracks the changes done to the files in the repository. When you initialize a repository, there are no commits because you should put in your own message when you have all the file sready for the first commit. 

How is the staging are adifferent from the workign directory and the repository. What value do you think it offers?

Right now, onlly lessons_1_reflections is to be commmitted to the repository. lesson_2 is still untracked. whatever commits I make to this branch, lesson_2 will still be in the directory on my harddrive.
